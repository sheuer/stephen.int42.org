        <p>
          Hello, my name is Stephen, and I am a co-founder of
          <a href="https://arux.software">Arux Software</a>,
          located in beautiful Downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. I have a passion for
          sustainable living and environmental conservation, which is reflected
          in my personal life.
          As a child raised in a third-tier suburb heavily dependent on cars,
          I held the belief that cars represented freedom and were the optimal
          form of transportation. Upon relocating to the city, and shifting to
          biking and public transit for the majority of my transportation
          requirements, my perception began to shift. With the addition of
          children and my significant other's adoption of biking, my perspective
          underwent a significant transformation, and I gained a deeper
          comprehension of how <a href="https://thewaroncars.org">cars ruin
          cities</a>. One of my favorite bikes is my
          <a href="https://www.larryvsharry.com/ebullitt">Larry vs Harry
          eBullitt</a> cargo bike, which has enabled me to substitute numerous
          car journeys and has transformed my mindset to prioritize biking for
          all types of trips, regardless of the weather conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my free time, when I'm not biking, I love exploring the outdoors
          through camping, hiking, canoeing, and swimming. I'm also an adventurous
          foodie, always eager to try new culinary experiences. At home, I've
          transformed my yard into a beautiful mix of Minnesota native prairie and
          a bountiful (sometimes) vegetable garden.
          We also keep chickens, and I took the lead in designing and constructing
          a chicken coop and treehouse, with the assistance of my family.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always been passionate about computers, starting with the Apple
          Macintosh 512k Enhanced that I used as a child. I built my own
          computers during my teenage years and learned various web technologies,
          including PHP, HTML, and JavaScript. In college, I took classes to
          learn Java, which is the only programming language that I did not teach
          myself. After starting Arux Software, I taught myself Ruby and other
          technologies to continue building innovative software solutions for our
          clients.
