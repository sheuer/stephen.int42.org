        <p>
          Hello, I'm Stephen, one of the co-founders of
          <a href="https://arux.software">Arux Software</a>, based in Downtown Minneapolis,
          Minnesota. Outside of work, I'm really into sustainable living and environmental conservation,
          values that shape both my personal and professional life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Growing up in a suburb heavily reliant on cars, I used to see them as the ultimate symbol of
          freedom and the best way to get around. However, when I moved to the city, I embraced biking and
          public transit for most of my transportation needs. As a person with kids and a partner who
          loves biking, my perspective on cars and their impact on cities completely changed. I now prioritize
          biking for various trips, no matter the weather. My go-to bike is the
          <a href="https://www.larryvsharry.com/ebullitt">Larry vs Harry
            eBullitt</a> cargo bike, which has replaced many car journeys and significantly shifted my mindset.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my downtime, when I'm not on my bike, I enjoy outdoor activities like camping, hiking, canoeing,
          and swimming. I'm also a bit of a foodie, always eager to try new culinary experiences. At home,
          I've turned my yard into a mix of Minnesota native prairie and a (sometimes) fruitful vegetable
          garden. We also keep chickens, and with my family's help, I designed and built a chicken coop and
          treehouse.
        </p>

        <p>
          My passion for computers goes way back to my childhood, starting with the Apple Macintosh 512k
          Enhanced. During my teenage years, I built my own computers and delved into web technologies like
          PHP, HTML, and JavaScript. In college, I took classes to learn Java, the only programming language
          I didn't teach myself. After founding Arux Software, I continued to expand my skills, teaching
          myself Ruby and other technologies to create innovative software solutions for our clients.
